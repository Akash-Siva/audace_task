Task: Automated Data Pipeline and Analysis for On-Chain Metrics
Objective:
Create an automated Python script to fetch, analyze, and visualize on-chain metrics for specific token pairs on Uniswap. 
The script should track real-time price movements and calculate liquidity and volume for a given token pair, as well as integrate 
alerts when significant price or volume changes occur.

Requirements:

Data Fetching and Processing:

Set up API integrations with Uniswapâ€™s subgraph or another reliable on-chain data provider to fetch real-time data for a specific token pair.
Pull data for the last 24 hours, including price, volume, and liquidity metrics, and store it in a structured format for analysis.
Include error handling to manage issues with API downtime or response errors.
Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts:

Implement a monitoring system that tracks price movements at a set interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) and calculates any 
significant changes over the last interval.
Set up an alert system (via email or SMS) to trigger notifications for price changes exceeding a 
threshold (e.g., 5%) or when liquidity falls below a certain level.
Data Analysis & Visualization:

Calculate daily average price, volume, and liquidity for the token pair.
Generate a line chart for price and volume changes over the 24-hour period.
Provide a summary of key metrics in a formatted output, including any unusual price spikes or dips.
Deliverables:

A Python script (well-documented and modular) that:
Fetches real-time on-chain data for a token pair.
Monitors and alerts on price and liquidity changes.
Analyzes and visualizes data with charts for easy interpretation.
A README file with setup instructions, usage guidelines, and potential improvements for scalability or additional functionality.

Evaluation Criteria:

Code quality, modularity, and readability.
Ability to handle real-time data efficiently.
Correctness and clarity of the analysis and visualizations.
Robustness of error handling and alerting mechanisms.
